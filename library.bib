The results reveal that the proposed algorithm possesses the following advantages: (1) it is capable of directly calibrating the position and orientation of the tool on the end-effector, and thereby totally removes trajectory errors which can not be eliminated by touching-off; (2) the unobservability of the parameters due to mobility constraints on the passive joints is completely avoided; (3) the algorithm is numerically robust, efficient and accurate that the calibrated parameter errors is kept to the same order of the measurement errors; and (4) the calibrated procedure can be performed automatically.

This six degrees of freedom tri-stage nanopositioner can generate small displacement, high-resolution motions with high accuracy by actuating three inexpensive, high quality planar stages. Each stage is equipped with linear actuators. In this paper, we discuss the calibration of the nanopositioner and methods to improve its accuracy. First, we derive the kinematic model of the nanopositioner that is a Stewart platform with spherical joints. Based on this kinematic model, we then calculate the actuation data for a set of commands for decoupled and coupled motions. We use an interferometer and an autocollimator to measure the actual displacement and rotation of the platform. Finally, we obtain the Jacobian matrix of the moving platform for the controller. Experiments showed that with the calibration-corrected parameters, the maximum error is approximately 0.002° in rotations and 3.3μm in translation for a workspace of ± 0.2° and ±200μm in x, y and z direction.},

For a given set of motion input parameters, the Stewart platform is possibly at the states of configuration bifurcation. In order that the Stewart platform can move at will when the length of links changes in a determinate region, we discuss the problems about the manipulator configuration and link length. The extreme configuration is presented based on the idea of analyzing the movement state of parallel manipulator in link space. Sixteen kinds of extreme configurations for Stewart platform are described with the vector expressions of link lengths. In order to avoid configuration bifurcations, the bifurcation characteristics of extreme configurations are analyzed by homotopy method and static bifurcation condition. The safety length of links is solved, which makes the manipulator work safely in the safety length area of links. The relationship between the safety length of links and the structural parameters is analyzed by numerical examples.},

A concise algebraic elimination algorithm to solve the closed-form forward kinematics of the Stewart platform is presented. Based on the presented algebraic method, an interesting result that comes out of our study is that the forward kinematics problem is reduced to solve a univariate polynomial equation of degree at most 14. The 14th degree univariate polynomial is derived from the determinant of the 15×15 Sylvester’s matrix, which is relatively small in size, without factoring out or deriving the greatest common divisor. The algorithm is comparatively concise and requires fairly less computation time. The result is verified by a numerical example.},

This, the first of a two-part series of papers on a novel piezo-driven, parallel-kinematics XYZ nanopositioning (PKXYZNP) stage, concentrates on the development of a viable scheme to achieve pure spatial translation. First, the mechanism is shown to admit closed-form solutions to both; the forward and reverse kinematic problems. The Jacobian and the dynamics of the system indicate that the mechanical structure produces a relatively large work volume, and is capable of high bandwidth and uniform performance across it. The fabrication of the system is described along with some basic testing of its Jacobian and its modal frequencies. Using capacitive gages, the stage is capable of about 85μm of motion along each axis with a resolution of about 2–4nm. The controls, testing and performance are discussed in detail in the companion paper [Dong J, Yao Q, Ferreira PM. A novel parallel-kinematics mechanism for integrated, multi-axis nanopositioning. Part 2. Dynamics, control and performance analysis. Precis Eng].},

	abstract = {In this paper, we discuss the dynamics, controls and performance of a parallel-kinematics, integrated, multi-axis nanopositioner, the PKXYZNP [Yao Q, Dong J, Ferreira PM. A novel parallel-kinematics mechanisms for integrated, multi-axis nano-positioning. Part 1: Kinematics and design for fabrications]. The paper focuses on computing the workspace of the stage, characterization of its dynamic behavior, synthesis of a controller for it, and the testing of its contour tracking and positioning performance. For this system, because of the coupled nature of the axes, a MIMO control scheme is adopted to directly close the loop around the kinematics of the stage, i.e., the position of the table/end-effector is fed back to control the actuators. This scheme has the added advantage of not requiring complex and fragile kinematic calibration of the stage as the accuracy becomes a function of only the accuracy of the sensing system and the servo performance. To make the MIMO control scheme tractable by reducing its order, the controller design is performed in the modal space of the system. A resolution of 2–4nm is achieved from this stage. Linear and circular tests were performed to evaluate the contouring performance of the PKXYZ stage. In spite of a relatively heavy load condition (the weight of a solid target), the linear and circular contouring errors are less than 40 and 150nm, respectively, with contouring speeds ranging up to 40μm/s.},

	abstract = {In this paper, a new forward kinematic algorithm based on dual quaternion for a six-degree-of-freedom (DOF) general Stewart Platform is proposed. The algorithm is established after taking into account the pose parameters of joints and the D–H parameters of each branch chain, which yields a precise mathematic model with a total of 174 geometric parameters. The validity of the algorithm is tested using an inverse kinematic algorithm of a general serial manipulator. The forward kinematic algorithms for the 6-6R and 6-2RP3R mechanisms can be expressed by a unified mathematic model. The proposed algorithm can solve the difficult problem of forward kinematics for the unsolved 6-6R parallel manipulator and can also be applied to error analysis, error synthesis, kinematic calibration, stiffness analysis and the accurate kinematic simulation by analysing the effect of geometric parameters on the platform.},

	abstract = {This paper considers the problem of improving the accuracy of parallel kinematics machine tools through a low-cost and effective calibration method. A novel orientation constraint of keeping two attitude angles of the end-effector constant is presented to derive the calibration algorithm with special insight on the effect of using various combinations of two angles. The orientation constraint of the selected combination is realized physically through leveling a commercial biaxial inclinometer installed on the end-effector. Benefits of the proposed method include exempting the needs for precise pose (position and orientation) measurement and for mechanical fixtures, as well as rendering the independence of the measuring range and angular positioning accuracy of the inclinometer. Simulation based on the geometry of the Stewart platform of XJ-HEXA shows the position and orientation accuracy can reach 0.1mm and 0.01° after calibration, when using an inclinometer with the repeatability of 0.001° and measuring the leg lengths with the precision of 0.002mm at 80 configurations. Experiments on XJ-HEXA further verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.},
